## Does LME Run in the Cloud? 

Yes. LME can run in the Cloud or on-premises environments. It's designed to work in personal or Cloud deployments, allowing organizations to host LME in their Cloud tenant (e.g., Azure) or connect on-premises clients to a cloud-hosted instance.

## Deploying LME in the Cloud for On-Premises Systems

You can set up LME in the Cloud and still send data from your on-premises endpoints. Here's how it works:

![cloud firewall](/docs/imgs/lme-cloud.jpg)

- You host the LME backend in the Cloud

- Your Elastic agents (installed on your endpoints) send logs to it over the internet

**Important: Ensure your firewall allows outbound traffic so your agents can connect.**

The easiest way is to make sure you can access these LME server ports from the on-premise client: 

- Wazuh Agent ([Agent Enrollment Requirements Documentation](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/user-manual/agent/agent-enrollment/requirements.html)): 1514,1515
    
- Elastic Agent ([Agent Install Documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elastic-stack/current/installing-stack-demo-self.html#install-stack-self-elastic-agent)): 8220 (fleet commands); 9200 (input to Elasticsearch)

You'll need to ensure your Cloud firewall is set up to allow the ports above. On Azure, Network Security Groups (NSG) run a firewall on your virtual machine's network interfaces.  You'll need to update your LME virtual machine's rules to allow inbound connections on the agent ports. Azure has a detailed guide for how to add security rules [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/manage-network-security-group?tabs=network-security-group-portal#create-a-security-rule). 

### ***We highly suggest you do not open any port globally and restrict it based on your client's IP address or your client's subnets.***

### For Debian Based Systems

On LME, you'll want to ensure that either:

- The firewall is fully disabled (if you're relying on your Cloud provider's firewall as the primary layer of defense)
 
- The necessary firewall rules are enabled to allow traffic through required ports

To check the firewall status, run:

  ```bash
  lme-user@ubuntu:~$ sudo ufw status
  Status: inactive
  ```

If Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) is active, verify that the following rules are in place:

  ```bash
  lme-user@ubuntu:~$ sudo ufw status
  Status: inactive
  
  To                         Action      From
  --                         ------      ----
  1514                       ALLOW       Anywhere
  1515                       ALLOW       Anywhere
  22                         ALLOW       Anywhere
  8220                       ALLOW       Anywhere
  1514 (v6)                  ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
  1515 (v6)                  ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
  22 (v6)                    ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
  8220 (v6)                  ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
  ```

You can enable these ports via the following command:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 1514
sudo ufw allow 1515
sudo ufw allow 8220
sudo ufw allow 9200
```

If you plan to use the Wazuh Application Programming Interface (API), you'll also need to allow port 55000:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 55000
```

To forward traffic to the container network and allow services to run properly, run:

```bash
ufw route allow in on eth0 out on podman1 to any port 443,1514,1515,5601,8220,9200 proto tcp
ufw route allow in on podman1
```

There's also a helpful StackOverflow article on [Configuring UFW for Podman on Port 443](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70870689/configure-ufw-for-podman-on-port-443), if needed. Your `podman1` network interface name may be different. Check the output of your network interfaces by running the following command to check if your interface is also called podman1: 

```bash
sudo -i podman network inspect lme | jq 'map(select(.name == "lme")) | map(.network_interface) | .[]'
```

To view your applied rules:

```bash
root@ubuntu:~# ufw show added
Added user rules (see 'ufw status' for running firewall):
ufw allow 22
ufw allow 1514
ufw allow 1515
ufw allow 8220
ufw route allow in on eth0 out on podman1 to any port 443,1514,1515,5601,8220,9200 proto tcp
ufw allow 443
ufw allow in on podman1
ufw allow 9200
root@ubuntu:~#
```


### For Red Hat/CentOS/RHEL Systems

#### ⚠️ Important: Reboot May Be Required After Firewall Changes

**After applying firewall configuration changes on any system, it is highly recommended to reboot the machine to ensure all networking and container rules take effect properly.**

```bash
# After configuring firewall rules, reboot the system
sudo reboot
```

This is especially important for:
- **Container networking changes** - Ensures podman interfaces and bridge networks restart correctly
- **Firewall rule persistence** - Confirms all permanent rules are properly loaded
- **Network interface binding** - Ensures proper interface-to-zone assignments
- **Service startup order** - Guarantees firewall, networking, and containers start in the correct sequence

Red Hat-based systems offer two main firewall management approaches:

1. **firewalld** (default) - Higher-level management tool with zones and services
2. **nftables** (direct) - Lower-level control with better performance

Choose the approach that best fits your environment and expertise level.

## Option 1: Using firewalld (Recommended for Most Users)

If you're running LME on Red Hat-based systems, you'll use `firewalld` instead of UFW for firewall management.

**Important Note:** In cloud environments like Azure, your cloud provider's Network Security Group (NSG) often acts as the primary firewall layer. You may find that traffic is allowed even when the Red Hat firewall doesn't have explicit rules, because the cloud NSG is handling the filtering.

### Important: LME Installation Behavior

**During LME installation on Red Hat systems, the firewall is automatically disabled to prevent container communication issues.** The LME ansible installation will stop and disable firewalld for you.

If you later want to re-enable the firewall for security hardening, you can use one of the configuration methods below:

### Automated Configuration (Recommended)

For the easiest setup, use our automated firewall configuration script (after LME install):

```bash
# Navigate to the LME directory
cd /path/to/LME

# Run the automated firewall configuration script
sudo ./scripts/configure_rhel_firewall.sh
```

This script will:
- Automatically detect your podman network interfaces and container subnets
- Configure all necessary firewall rules for LME
- Provide verification and troubleshooting information
- Handle the complexity of dynamic interface names and network configurations

### Manual Configuration

For advanced users who need custom firewall configurations or troubleshooting, the automated script performs the equivalent of the following operations:

- Adds LME required ports (1514, 1515, 8220, 9200, 5601, 443) to the public zone
- Optionally adds Wazuh API port (55000) to the public zone  
- Detects and configures container network subnets in the trusted zone
- Detects and configures podman interfaces in the trusted zone
- Enables masquerading for container traffic
- Reloads firewall configuration to apply changes

**For manual configuration details, refer to the automated script source code at `./scripts/configure_rhel_firewall.sh` which contains all the necessary commands with proper error handling and network detection.**

### Troubleshooting Red Hat Firewall + Cloud Environment

If you're experiencing connectivity issues:

1. **Check your cloud provider's security groups** (Azure NSG, AWS Security Groups, etc.)

2. **Verify which network layer is filtering traffic:**
   ```bash
   # Check if Red Hat firewall has the ports open
   sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-ports
   
   # If ports are listed but still not accessible, check cloud NSG
   # If ports are not listed, add them with the commands above
   ```

3. **Test with firewall temporarily disabled:**
   ```bash
   # TEMPORARILY disable firewall for testing
   sudo systemctl stop firewalld
   # Test your connections
   # Re-enable firewall
   sudo systemctl start firewalld
   ```

4. **Check firewall logs for blocked connections:**
   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -u firewalld | tail -20
   ```

5. **For defense in depth, configure both layers** (cloud NSG + Red Hat firewall)

If problems persist, consider using the automated configuration script which handles edge cases and provides detailed troubleshooting information.

## Option 2: Using nftables (Advanced Users)

For users who prefer direct nftables management or want better performance, LME includes a dedicated nftables configuration script that provides equivalent functionality to the firewalld approach.

### When to Choose nftables over firewalld:

- **Performance requirements** - Lower overhead and faster packet processing
- **Direct control** - Fine-grained rule management without abstraction layers
- **Existing nftables infrastructure** - Already using nftables in your environment
- **Minimal overhead** - Prefer lightweight firewall management
- **Advanced customization** - Need specific rule configurations not easily achieved with firewalld

### Automated nftables Configuration (Recommended)

Use the automated nftables configuration script for the easiest setup:

```bash
# Navigate to the LME directory
cd /path/to/LME

# Run the nftables configuration script
sudo ./scripts/configure_lme_nftables.sh
```

This script will:
- **Automatically detect** your container networks and interfaces
- **Prevent conflicts** by optionally disabling firewalld
- **Create persistent rules** that survive reboots via `/etc/nftables.conf`
- **Provide equivalent functionality** to the firewalld configuration
- **Include troubleshooting** and verification capabilities
- **Backup existing rules** before making changes

### What the Script Configures:

**Input Rules (Public Access):**
- Port 1514/tcp - Wazuh agent communication
- Port 1515/tcp - Wazuh agent enrollment
- Port 8220/tcp - Fleet server
- Port 9200/tcp - Elasticsearch
- Port 5601/tcp - Kibana
- Port 443/tcp - HTTPS
- Port 55000/tcp - Wazuh API (optional)

**Container Network Rules:**
- Allows all traffic from container subnets
- Permits communication on podman interfaces
- Enables container-to-container communication

**NAT/Masquerading Rules:**
- Masquerades container traffic for external access
- Handles traffic forwarding between container and host networks

### Manual nftables Configuration

For advanced users who need custom nftables configurations, the automated script creates comprehensive rules that can be reviewed and customized in `/etc/nftables/lme.nft`.

**For manual configuration details, refer to the automated script source code at `./scripts/configure_lme_nftables.sh` which generates all necessary nftables rules with proper network detection and persistence configuration.**

### Verifying nftables Configuration:

```bash
# Check if nftables rules are loaded
sudo nft list ruleset

# View LME-specific tables
sudo nft list table inet lme_filter
sudo nft list table ip lme_nat

# Test container communication
sudo -i podman exec lme-kibana curl -s http://lme-elasticsearch:9200/_cluster/health
```

### Troubleshooting nftables Setup:

1. **Check rule application:**
   ```bash
   sudo nft list ruleset | grep -A 5 -B 5 lme
   ```

2. **Monitor dropped packets:**
   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -f | grep LME_DROPPED
   ```

3. **Test with rules temporarily disabled:**
   ```bash
   # Backup current rules
   sudo nft list ruleset > /tmp/nft_backup.nft
   
   # Remove LME tables for testing
   sudo nft delete table inet lme_filter
   sudo nft delete table ip lme_nat
   
   # Test connectivity
   # Restore rules
   sudo nft -f /etc/nftables/lme.nft
   ```

4. **Verify service startup:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status nftables
   sudo systemctl enable nftables
   ```

### Important Notes for nftables Users:

- **firewalld conflicts**: The script can optionally disable firewalld to prevent rule conflicts
- **Persistence**: Rules are automatically added to `/etc/nftables.conf` for persistence across reboots
- **Cloud compatibility**: Works with cloud provider firewalls (NSGs, Security Groups) as an additional layer
- **Container networking**: Automatically detects and configures container subnets and interfaces

## Summary: Choosing Your Red Hat Firewall Approach

| Aspect | firewalld | nftables |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Ease of Use** | ✅ Beginner-friendly | ⚠️ Advanced users |
| **Performance** | Good | ✅ Better (lower overhead) |
| **Management** | Zone-based, abstracted | Direct rule control |
| **Default on RHEL** | ✅ Yes | Available |
| **LME Compatibility** | ✅ Fully supported | ✅ Fully supported |
| **Cloud Environment** | ✅ Works with NSGs | ✅ Works with NSGs |
| **Automation Script** | `configure_rhel_firewall.sh` | `configure_lme_nftables.sh` |

**Recommendation:**
- **New to firewall management?** Use **firewalld** (Option 1)
- **Performance critical environment?** Use **nftables** (Option 2)
- **Existing nftables setup?** Use **nftables** (Option 2)
- **Default choice for most users:** **firewalld** (Option 1)

Both approaches provide identical security and functionality for LME - choose based on your preference and requirements.

## Deploying LME for Cloud Infrastructure

Every Cloud setup is different. As long as the LME server is on the same network and able to talk to the machines you want to monitor, your deployment should run smoothly.

## Other Firewall Rules

You may also want to access Kibana from outside the Cloud as well. You'll want to ensure you either allow port `5601` or port `443` inbound from the Cloud firewall and the virtual machine firewall. 

To allow port 443:

```bash
root@ubuntu:/opt/lme# sudo ufw allow 443
Rule added
Rule added (v6)
```

Sample firewall status (active):

```bash
root@ubuntu:/opt/lme# sudo ufw status
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
22                         ALLOW       Anywhere
1514                       ALLOW       Anywhere
1515                       ALLOW       Anywhere
8220                       ALLOW       Anywhere
443                        ALLOW       Anywhere
22 (v6)                    ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
1514 (v6)                  ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
1515 (v6)                  ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
8220 (v6)                  ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
443 (v6)                   ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
```

### Don't Lock Yourself Out and Enable the Firewall

Before enabling the firewall, ensure you're not blocking your Secure Shell (SSH) access. You must allow port 22 so you can still connect remotely:
 
```bash
sudo ufw allow 22
```

Once all necessary ports are allowed, enable the firewall with:

```bash
sudo ufw enable
```
