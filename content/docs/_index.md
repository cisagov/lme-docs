# Logging Made Easy 

CISA's Logging Made Easy (LME) is a no cost, open source platform that centralizes log collection, enhances threat detection, and enables real-time alerting, helping small to medium-sized organizations secure their infrastructure. Whether you're upgrading from a previous version or deploying for the first time, LME offers a scalable, efficient solution for logging and endpoint security. 

Check out the LME introduction video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZFV6ZOLg7s).

## Who is Logging Made Easy for?

From single IT administrators with a handful of devices in their network to small and medium-sized agencies. Really, for anyone! 
LME is intended for organizations that:
- Need a log management and threat detection system.
- Do not have an existing Security Operations Center (SOC), Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution or log management and monitoring capabilities.
- Work within limited budgets, time or expertise to set up and manage a logging and threat detection system.

## Installation
Please view the [install guide](/docs/markdown/install.md).

## Updates 

For LME's 2.0 release, we’re introducing several new features and architectural components to improve Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) capabilities while simplifying overall use of LME:

- **Enhanced Threat Detection and Response**: Integrated Wazuh’s and Elastic's open-source tools, along with ElastAlert, for improved detection accuracy and real-time alerting. 
- **Security by Design**: Introduced Podman containerization and encryption to meet the highest security standards.
- **Simplified Installation**: Added Ansible scripts to automate deployment for faster setup and easier maintenance.
- **Custom Data Visualization**: Design and customize dashboards with Kibana to meet specific monitoring needs.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Expanded unit testing and threat emulation ensure system stability and reliability.


LME 2.0 is fully operational and built to deliver effective log management and threat detection. As part of our commitment to continuous improvement, future updates, including version 2.1, will introduce additional enhancements for scalability and deployment flexibility.
