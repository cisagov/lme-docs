1,Install,Is it possible to install and host LME on a VM?,"Yes, it is possible to install and host Logging Made East (LME) on a virtual machine by following the installation steps on an Ubuntu version 22.04 virtual machine. ",LME Office Hours,2/25/25,
2,Install,What options are available to install LME on Raspberry Pi?,LME does not recommend installation on a Raspberry Pi as these devices donâ€™t typically have enough RAM to host the tool and allow for smooth functioning. ,LME Office Hours,2/25/25,
3,Alerting,"Do you have any additional resources on setting up email alerts with ElastAlert2? We got the email function working, but copying built-in alerts has been labor-intensive",LME has documentation related to ElastAlert rule-writing. ,LME Office Hours,2/25/25,https://github.com/cisagov/LME/blob/main/docs/markdown/maintenance/elastalert-rules.md
4,Install,The LME installation guide only shows how to install agents (Elastic and Wazuh) manually. Can we push them out to multiple hosts with Group Policy Object (GPO)? ,"Yes, this is possible, but users need to configure the deployment. LME had old GPOs for LME 1.0â€”adapting them for the new version would be a great community contribution",LME Office Hours,2/25/25,
5,Agents,Is there a guide for Microsoft installers? ,"For Wazuh, users can reference the wiki on downloading the MSI.",LME Office Hours,2/25/25,https://github.com/cisagov/LME/blob/main/docs/markdown/agents/wazuh-agent-mangement.md
6,Dashboards,How do I use the Wazuh Incident Response dashboard effectively? I see a list of rule matches but can't find a way to drill down into them to understand what triggered each rule. How can I turn these matches into actionable insights? ,LME doesnâ€™t have documentation on this yet as it's a new feature. LME plans to add it in the future to provide more transparency on dashboards and guidance on setting up active response. ,LME Office Hours,2/25/25,
7,Reporting,Do you have documentation on how to set up a remote site with LME and send the data to the LME running at the primary site for consolidated reporting?,"No, LME does not have documentation related to consolidated reporting.",LME Office Hours,2/25/25,
8,Log Management,"Can LME agents forward logs to multiple LME hosts, or would the remote LME host need to forward logs to the upstream LME host? Iâ€™d like LME running at multiple offices for local IT use while also forwarding data to the main IT location running LME. ","No, LME has not explored this yet. Users could reference Wazuh or Elasticâ€™s documentation to see if itâ€™s possible. ",LME Office Hours,2/25/25,
9,Community,Is there an LME chat like Discord or Slack? ,"No, this isnâ€™t currently supported, but LME is actively exploring it. Users are encouraged to post questions in GitHub Discussions to connect with the LME community and others with similar experiences. ",LME Office Hours,2/25/25,
10,Containers,Are there instructions on keeping the containers up to date or are they locked to a specific version? ,"The containers are currently locked; however, LME is exploring the possibility of updating them for future releases. ",LME Office Hours,2/25/25,
11,Alerting,Can LME send text alert along with email alert? ,This could be possible with a Twilio account. Users are encouraged to review the ElastAlert documentation.,LME Office Hours,2/25/25,https://github.com/cisagov/LME/blob/main/docs/markdown/maintenance/elastalert-rules.md
12,Upgrading,Should I update Ubuntu if I'm running LME?,"Updating Ubuntu is at the discretion of the user; however, LME 2.0.2 has been successfully tested with Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04. ",LME Office Hours,4/28/25,
13,Upgrading,Does upgrading Ubuntu impact LME stability or performance?,"When Testing Ubuntu Versions 22.04 and 24.04, LME detected no performance impacts.",LME Office Hours,4/28/25,
14,Upgrading,Is it safe to run apt update or apt upgrade while LME is installed and running?,LME has not tested apt update and apt upgrade. LME may integrate these commands in the future.,LME Office Hours,4/28/25,
15,Upgrading,Do I need to upgrade the server if a new vesrion of Ubuntu is released?,"Updating Ubuntu is at the discretion of the user; however, we recommend using Ubuntu 22.04 or 24.04 as they have been tested with LME 2.0.2.",LME Office Hours,4/28/25,
16,Install,Where can I find configuration or installation documentation for LME?,Users can find configuration and installation documentation on LME’s GitHub within the README.,LME Office Hours,4/28/25,https://github.com/cisagov/LME#3-downloading-and-installing-lme
17,Documentation,Are there beginner-friendly resources available?,"Yes, LME has documentation and videos available to support your deployment.",LME Office Hours,4/28/25,
18,Compliance,Does LME support NIST 800-53 or CMMC compliance? Is there any documentation on how LME maps to these standards?,"there is no official mapping between LME and these frameworks.
Mapping specific controls or compliance team would typically be responsible for this assessment. As a starting point, many Kibana detection rules map to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which can help inform control alignment.",LME Office Hours,4/28/25,
19,Alerting,What's the difference between alerts configured in Kibana and those set in the ElasAlert2 rules directory?,"Kibana alerts are built-in detection rules created and managed through the Kibana interface. While they can detect events based on log data, sending those alerts to external destinations like Slack, email, or Microsoft Teams requires a paid Elastic license.
On the other hand, ElastAlert2 is an open-source alerting engine that handles alert notifications. The detection logic still relies on Kibana’s rules, but ElastAlert2 watches for matching events and sends alert messages to your preferred destinations without requiring a paid license.",LME Office Hours,4/28/25,
20,Alerting,Why use ElastAlert2 instead of Kibana alerting? Are there cost advantages or functionality differences?,"LME uses the open source version of Elastic, which doesn't include Kibana's built-in alert and notification features. Because those features require a paid Elastic license, LME relies on ElastAlert2 as our alerting engine to provide no cost alerting and notifications to email, Slack, Teams, etc.",LME Office Hours,4/28/25,
21,Upgrading,"If we upgrade to a paid Elastic license, will LME still work?","LME operates effectively with a paid Elastic license, but LME has not tested this nor is it planned.",LME Office Hours,4/28/25,
22,Integrations,Can LME integrate with cloud services like Okta or Meraki?,"Yes, LME can ingest a wide range of log types using Elastic’s official integrations, including cloud services like Okta and Cisco Meraki. These integrations allow the Elastic Agent to collect, parse, and forward log data to LME",,4/28/25,
23,Integrations,What's the best way to ingest logs from cloud services like Okta or Meraki?,"The recommended approach is to use Elastic Agent integrations to collect logs from these services. Specifically:
•	Okta Integration
•	Cisco Meraki Integration
While LME is not configured to ingest these logs by default, users can follow Elastic’s documentation to configure integrations. Some integrations may require Application Programming interface (API) keys or external log forwarding (via syslog or HTTP, etc.), and advanced use cases may involve custom parsing or pipeline adjustments",,4/28/25,
24,Compliance,"Is LME FIPS-validated, or does it rely on Ubuntu's Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) validation for compliance?","LME isn’t created from scratch. It’s integrated into industry standard services from Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Kibana). It boasts added customizations such as dashboards, alerting, and simple installation.
LME has not gone through FIPS validation. Whether that can or cannot meet individual organization standards is dependent upon the ability to install Elastic If available, it should meet your standards. LME’s development of the install process intends to meet CISA’s “Secure by Design” requirements.
As a point of pride, LME is a secure installation of the Elastic Stack. Other requirements that one may desire, such as two-factor authentication, are not yet a feature of LME so your organization would need to implement independently. That functionality is a paid service from Elastic.",,4/28/25,
